## Naming Conventions

All research artifacts follow this naming convention:
- `YYYY-MM-DD_experiment-name` for directories and primary files
- Include metadata files (JSON/YAML) for each research project
- Document data sources and preprocessing steps

## Data Management Best Practices

1. **Version Control:** Research reports are version controlled
2. **Metadata:** Each research project includes metadata file
3. **Compression:** Large datasets should be compressed
4. **Git LFS:** Files > 50MB should use Git LFS
5. **Documentation:** Data sources and methodology must be documented
6. **Privacy:** No sensitive or proprietary data without proper authorization
